# Customer Spending Prediction using Stacked Regression Model

## Project Overview

This project predicts the yearly amount spent by customers in an online store using a stacked regression model. It integrates data preprocessing, model training, and prediction into a single pipeline designed for production environments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a stacking regressor combining linear regression and gradient boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² for performance evaluation.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Seamlessly integrates preprocessing and model prediction for new data.
